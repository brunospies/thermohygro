2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
SYNTH-6#1 Warning
Timing of a RAM block might be sub-optimal  
The timing for the instance Ecran/bitmap_reg_0, implemented as a RAM block, might be sub-optimal as no output register was merged into the block.
Related violations: <none>

SYNTH-6#2 Warning
Timing of a RAM block might be sub-optimal  
The timing for the instance Ecran/bitmap_reg_1, implemented as a RAM block, might be sub-optimal as no output register was merged into the block.
Related violations: <none>

SYNTH-6#3 Warning
Timing of a RAM block might be sub-optimal  
The timing for the instance Ecran/bitmap_reg_2, implemented as a RAM block, might be sub-optimal as no output register was merged into the block.
Related violations: <none>

SYNTH-6#4 Warning
Timing of a RAM block might be sub-optimal  
The timing for the instance Ecran/bitmap_reg_3, implemented as a RAM block, might be sub-optimal as no output register was merged into the block.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#1 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An input delay is missing on reset relative to the rising and/or falling clock edge(s) of sys_clk_pin.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#2 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on PMOD_CS relative to the rising and/or falling clock edge(s) of sys_clk_pin.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#3 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on PMOD_DC relative to the rising and/or falling clock edge(s) of sys_clk_pin.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#4 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on PMOD_EN relative to the rising and/or falling clock edge(s) of sys_clk_pin.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#5 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on PMOD_MOSI relative to the rising and/or falling clock edge(s) of sys_clk_pin.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#6 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on PMOD_RES relative to the rising and/or falling clock edge(s) of sys_clk_pin.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#7 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on PMOD_SCK relative to the rising and/or falling clock edge(s) of sys_clk_pin.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#8 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on PMOD_VCCEN relative to the rising and/or falling clock edge(s) of sys_clk_pin.
Related violations: <none>
